# Kanban/Issue Tracker with React

A kanban board that I built with React to use for error tracking. Has click to edit functionality and full drag and drop ability. For now there is local storage built in but I plan to build a back end for it with Node.

Version 1.0 is complete, albeit with a few small fixes needing to be done. Version 2.0 is being worked on which will include the feature of homepage where the user can create new boards and navegate to all the various boards they have created.
